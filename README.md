### 👋 Hey, I’m Ayush

I’m a CS + Math student at the University of Maryland, and I love using data to model complex systems—whether in markets, sports, or games.

Right now, I’m building:

- 🧠 A stock direction predictor using LSTMs and Fourier transforms  
- ♟️ A real-time chess betting platform where users can wager on individual moves and outcomes

I'm especially excited about projects that sit at the intersection of **data, strategy, and real-world uncertainty**.

Outside of school, I’m actively studying competitive poker strategy and game theory, and plan to start playing in live tournaments once I turn 21.

If you're into quant research, real-time systems, or weird ideas involving chess, sports-betting, and trading, let’s connect!

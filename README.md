### 👋 Hey, I’m Ayush

I’m a CS and Math student at the University of Maryland, and I love using data to model complex systems. Whether it's markets, sports, or games, I'm drawn to environments where decisions matter.

Right now, I’m building:

- 🧠 A stock direction predictor using LSTMs and Fourier transforms  
- ♟️ A real-time chess betting platform where users can wager on individual moves and outcomes
- 🤖 A simulation project exploring how market-making bots behave under different levels of information access in prediction markets.

I’ve had the chance to work at places like **Scale AI** and **Rithmm**, where I built machine learning models for sports prediction and misinformation detection. I'm currently interning at **Capital One** as a **Gen AI SWE Intern**. Those experiences have shaped the way I think about uncertainty, pattern recognition, and edge.

Outside of school, I’m a **1930-rated chess player** and have made over **$3K** playing competitive poker.

I’m especially excited about projects that sit at the intersection of data, strategy, and real-world behavior. If you're into quant research, real-time systems, or weird ideas involving chess, sports betting, and trading, let’s connect!

### 👋 Hey, I’m Ayush

I’m a CS and Math student at the University of Maryland, and I love using data to model complex systems. Whether it's markets, sports, or games, I'm drawn to environments where decisions matter.

Right now, I’m working on:

- ♟️ Predicting Magnus Carlsen’s next move using real-time probabilities, combining Stockfish analysis with style-based clustering

I recently built:
- 🤖 A market-making simulator that explores how bots behave under different levels of information access in prediction markets
- 🧠 A stock direction predictor using LSTMs, and might explore adding Fourier-based signal analysis in the future

I’ve worked at Scale AI, a sports betting startup, and Capital One, where I built predictive models and Gen AI systems across different domains. Those experiences taught me to look for patterns in noise, understand uncertainty, and find edge where others overlook it.

Outside of school, I’m a **1930-rated chess player** and have made over **$3K** playing competitive poker.

I’m especially excited about projects that sit at the intersection of data, strategy, and real-world behavior. If you're into quant research, real-time systems, or weird ideas involving chess, sports betting, and trading, reach out!

### 👋 Hey, I’m Ayush

I’m a CS and Math student at the University of Maryland, and I love using data to model complex systems. Whether it's markets, sports, or games, I'm drawn to environments where decisions matter.

Right now, I’m building:

- 🧠 A stock direction predictor using LSTMs and Fourier transforms  
- ♟️ A real-time chess betting platform where users can wager on individual moves and outcomes

I’ve had the chance to work at places like Scale AI and Rithmm, where I built machine learning models for sports prediction and misinformation detection. Those experiences shaped the way I think about uncertainty, pattern recognition, and edge.

Outside of school, I’m 1900-rated in chess and have made over $3K playing online poker. I’ve been studying game theory seriously and plan to enter live tournaments once I turn 21.

I’m especially excited about projects that sit at the intersection of data, strategy, and real-world behavior. If you're into quant research, real-time systems, or weird ideas involving chess, sports betting, and trading, let’s connect!
